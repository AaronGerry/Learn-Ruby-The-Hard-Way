# 7) The sixth animal is at 5 and is a platypus

# Study Drills 

# 1) With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, 
# can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," 
# really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

# Answer: Dates are ordinal, they follow a linear progression, and they have to be 
# in reference to each other. Ie., there is no start of time and no end of time, 
# so there is not really a "zeroth", we started with year 1

# 2)

boston_cities = ['somerville', 'charlestown', 'dorchester', 'cambridge', 'roxbury']

# The third city is dorchester, and is at 2
# The city at 5 is nil
# The city at 4 is roxbury, and is the fifth city
# The second city is charlestown, and is at 1
# The city at 3 is cambridge, and is the fourth city
